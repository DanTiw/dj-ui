# UI Component Library

A modern, accessible, and customizable UI component library built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI primitives.

## Features

- üé® Customizable with CSS variables and Tailwind
- ü§ù Accessible components using Radix UI primitives
- üåô Light and dark mode support
- üì¶ Modular components for easy importing
- üîÑ Reusable utilities for common patterns

## Components

The library includes the following components:

- **Button**: A customizable button component with various styles
- **Card**: A versatile card component with header, content, and footer
- **Checkbox**: An accessible checkbox input
- **Input**: A styled input field
- **Select**: A customizable dropdown select component

## Usage

Import the components you need:

```tsx
import { Button, Card, Input } from "@/components/ui";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Card>

        <Input placeholder="Enter your name" />
        <Button>Submit</Button>
